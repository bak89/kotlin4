# Bitcoin PJ Kotlin

Implement a TornadoFX UI that shows the current prices for Bitoins. The Bitcoin prices must be retrieved online in an asynchronous way using Kotlin coroutines.

The Bitcoin prices in the UI should be updated automatically (in the background). The UI must stay reactive for user manipulations.

A history of changing prices is maintained and shown to the user. A history record contains at least the timestamp and the price of Bitcoins  in 3 currencies.
